**Hotel Revenue Analysis**

This is a data analysis project that I developed by importing CSV file into Microsoft SQL Management Studio. 

The file consists of several years of hotel data from 2018 to 2019.

Using CTE to do recursive queries for showing employees' hierarchy at hotel.

Creating pivot tables to aggregate the data for visualization and data analysis.

Using window functions in aggregattion functions, ranking and filtering a portion of rows (frame).

Define and execute stored procedures with input and output parameters.
